# Water-Level-Indicator-and-Controller-
The Water Level Indicator and Controller automates tank water management using hookup wires placed at different tank levels. These detect water level and send signals to a control circuit that displays the level on a 7-segment display. The pump turns ON at low level and OFF at high level, preventing overflow and dry running.
